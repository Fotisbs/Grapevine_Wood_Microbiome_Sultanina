## Microbiome (Metataxonomic) analyses

The microbiome workflow is organized into four sequential steps:

0. Download raw sequencing data
1. Demultiplex sequencing reads
2. Construct phyloseq objects
3. Perform downstream statistical analyses


***Step 0. First, it is necessary to download the sequencing data***

To do so, you need to enter the "0.DownloadData" subfolder of "Fungi" and "Bacteria" folders accordingly and execute the "fetch_data.sh" bash script for batch (01), this assumes that you are located at the working directory "Grapevine_Vinifications_Vidiano_2019-".

The script downloads all raw amplicon sequencing reads deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive using the corresponding SRR accession numbers listed in the batch files.Once the download is done, you need to combine all forward reads to a single file and all reverse reads to another file as well.
```
for i in {01}
do
	cd Fungi/0.DownloadData/batch${i}
	sh -x fetch_data.sh
	cat *_1.fastq | gzip > forward.fastq.gz
	cat *_2.fastq | gzip > reverse.fastq.gz
	cd ../../../
	cd Bacteria/0.DownloadData/batch${i}
	sh -x fetch_data.sh
	cat *_1.fastq | gzip > forward.fastq.gz
	cat *_2.fastq | gzip > reverse.fastq.gz
	cd ../../../
done
```

***Step 1. Then you need to demultiplex the data according to our own demultiplexing method using our in-house script***

This step requires Flexbar v3.0.3 together with the mapping file (map_file) provided in the corresponding folder. A detailed description of our in-house multiplexing approach is provided in (https://github.com/SotiriosVasileiadis/mconsort_tbz_degr#16s).
You need to enter the folder Fungi (or Bacteria)/1.Demultiplex and run the following commands (change the MY_PROCS variable to whatever number of logical processors you have available and want to devote),
the following commands are going to save the demultiplexed files in the Fungi(or Bacteria)/1.Demultiplex/demux_out folder.

```
The demultiplexing workflow follows the protocol described in: https://github.com/SotiriosVasileiadis/mconsort_tbz_degr#16s
```

***Step 2. The script `Vinification Vidiano 2019 Quality-Classification-Phyloseq Object.R` constructs the final phyloseq object used for all downstream microbiome analyses.***

PhyloseqObjectPreparation folder is run in order to prepare the final phyloseq object to be used in the data analysis described below. Before running the script make sure that the necessary reference databases are found in the same folder. The taxonomic annotations of the resulting fungal and bacterial ASVs were performed using the UNITE ITS v.8.2 (04.02.2020) (Morrison-Whittle et al., 2017) and the Silva v.138 (Yilmaz et al., 2014) databases as references respectively. The sample metadata file (samdf.txt), included in the repository, is also required for construction of the phyloseq objects.
```
cd Fungi/2.PhyloseqObjectPreparation
# fetch the databases
wget https://files.plutof.ut.ee/public/orig/1D/B9/1DB95C8AC0A80108BECAF1162D761A8D379AF43E2A4295A3EF353DD1632B645B.gz
# run the R script
Fungi Vinification Vidiano 2019 Quality-Classification-Phyloseq Object.r
cd ../../
cd Bacteria/2.PhyloseqObjectPreparation
# fetch the databases
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4587955/files/silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4587955/files/silva_nr99_v138.1_wSpecies_train_set.fa.gz
tar vxf *.gz
# run the R script
Bacteria Vinification Vidiano 2019 Quality-Classification-Phyloseq Object.r
cd ../../
```
***Step 3. The data analysis folder includes independent R scripts reproducing all microbiome analyses and figures presented in the manuscript***

```
- Taxonomic composition
- Beta-diversity (NMDS)
- Beta-diversity statistics (PERMANOVA)
- Rarefaction curves
- Alpha-diversity metrics
- Differential abundance heatmaps
```

## Metatranscriptomic analyses

Metatranscriptomic analyses are organized into three sequential steps: (0) retrieval of raw sequencing data, (1) functional annotation using the SAMSA2 pipeline, and (2) statistical analyses in R.

***Step 0. First, it is necessary to download the RNA sequencing data***

Download the RNA sequencing data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.
To do so, you need to enter the "0.DownloadData" subfolder of "Metatranscriptomic" and execute the "fetch_data.sh" bash script for batch (01), this assumes that you are located at the working directory "Grapevine_Vinifications_Vidiano_2019-". The RNA sequencing data deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive are retrieved using the provided SRR accession numbers contained in the batch text files and can be found in the 0.DownloadData folder.Once the download is done, you need to combine all forward reads to a single file and all reverse reads to another file as well.
```
for i in {01}
do
    cd Metatranscriptomic/0.DownloadData/batch${i}
    sh -x fetch_data.sh
    cat *_1.fastq | gzip > forward.fastq.gz
    cat *_2.fastq | gzip > reverse.fastq.gz
    cd ../../../
done
```

***Step 1. Functional annotation with SAMSA2***

Raw paired-end RNA sequencing reads were processed using the SAMSA2 v2.2.0 pipeline (Westreich et al., 2018).
The complete preprocessing workflow is provided in

```
master_script_final.bash
```

### The pipeline automatically performs the following steps
```
- Quality trimming using Trimmomatic
- Paired-end read merging using PEAR
- Removal of residual rRNA sequences using SortMeRNA
- Functional annotation against the RefSeq database using DIAMOND BLASTx
- Functional annotation against the SEED Subsystems database
- Generation of organism-level, gene-level and subsystem count tables
- Initial differential expression analyses using the SAMSA2 R scripts
```
The pipeline can be executed with

```
sh master_script_final.bash
```

***Step 2. Statistical analyses in R*** 

The downstream statistical analyses presented in the manuscript were performed in R using the annotation tables generated by SAMSA2.

The required input files are

```
FinalNames.txt
ExperimentalDesign.txt
```
The processed functional annotation table (`FinalNames.txt`) and the experimental design file (`ExperimentalDesign.txt`) are included in this repository and serve as the input for all downstream statistical analyses. The original SAMSA2 pipeline (`master_script_final.bash`) used to generate these annotation tables is also provided for reproducibility.

The analysis folder contains independent R scripts reproducing all transcriptomic analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.

```
- NMDS ordination
- PERMANOVA
- DESeq2 differential gene expression (Volcano plot)
- DESeq2 differential gene expression heatmaps
- DESeq2 functional subsystem analysis
```

All downstream statistical analyses were performed in R using **DESeq2**. Separate scripts are provided for each analysis, and different statistical designs were applied depending on the biological question addressed:

**Volcano plot (overall comparison between fermentation strategies)**
```
Differential expression was estimated using the model

design = ~ Vinification + Stage
```
**Differential expression heatmaps (stage-specific analyses)**
```
Genes were identified using pairwise contrasts between inoculated and spontaneous fermentations
performed independently within each fermentation stage (Start, Middle and End).
DESeq2-normalized counts were subsequently used for visualization.
```
**Functional subsystem analysis (stage-specific analyses)**
```
Subsystem abundances were compared between inoculated and spontaneous fermentations
 independently within each fermentation stage using DESeq2 pairwise contrasts.
```

Together, these scripts reproduce all metatranscriptomic analyses and figures presented in the manuscript, starting from the processed annotation tables generated by the SAMSA2 workflow and ending with the final statistical analyses and visualizations.

### Software requirements

The analyses were performed in R (v4.3.1) using the packages:

- phyloseq
- vegan
- DESeq2
- ggplot2
- pheatmap
- dplyr
- agricolae
- apeglm
- ggrepel
- RColorBrewer

The metatranscriptomic preprocessing workflow additionally requires:

- SAMSA2 v2.2.0
- Trimmomatic v0.39
- PEAR v0.9.10
- SortMeRNA v2.1b
- DIAMOND v2.0.11
